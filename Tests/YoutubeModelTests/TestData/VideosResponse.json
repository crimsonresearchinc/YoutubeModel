The Feb. 27 launch attempt was scrubbed so mission teams could investigate a ground systems issue.

They'll spend approximately six months on the station, helping us learn how to live in space while conducting research to make life better back on Earth. Learn more about the mission, its crew, and some of the science they'll be working on at https://go.nasa.gov/3jclMmJ. \n\nFollowing launch and ascent, NASA coverage of agency’s Crew-6 flight to the space station will temporarily switch to a streaming, audio-only feed accessible via YouTube, between ascent and the beginning of rendezvous operations.
